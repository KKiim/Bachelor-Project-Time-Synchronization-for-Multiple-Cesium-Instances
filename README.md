# Bachelor-Project: Time Synchronization for Multiple Cesium Instances
* Mentor, University: Dr. Karsten Klein, Universit√§t Konstanz
* Student: Kim Lasse Rehberg


###  Abstract
This Implementation creates the Websocket Server to synchronize multible Cesium instances of the Bird Visualisation.

### Initial Setup

The WS folder may be placed anyware on your PC.

The Sync folder goes in the Cesium root directory. 

The HTML-file 1SyncBird.html goes in Apps/Sandcastle/gallery

If you use a new Cesium file, it has to be initialized with <npm install>.

The 2014-08-07.kml file goes in Apps/SampleData/kml

The FlyingBird folder goes in Apps/SampleData/models


### Start the App

Start the WebSocket:
* cd to the WS folder
* -node server.js- starts the WebSocket-Server

Start Cesium:

  * On a Windows with node just start it the usaual way: cd to Cesium and <node server.js>
  * Master Display: http://localhost:PORT/Apps/Sandcastle/gallery/1SyncBird.html?mode=master
  * Slave Displays: http://localhost:PORT/Apps/Sandcastle/gallery/1SyncBird.html?mode=slave
OR
* Host this directory on a server.
  * On a Linux machine with an Apache server, it could be placed at /var/www/html/ the application can now be accessed at:
  * Master Display: http://localhost:PORT/Apps/Sandcastle/gallery/1SyncBird.html?mode=m
  * Slave Displays: http://localhost:PORT/Apps/Sandcastle/gallery/1SyncBird.html?mode=s
OR
  * On Windows/Linux/Mac? machine you can use python2 with the command: python -m SimpleHTTPServer <port>
  * On Windows/Linux/Mac? machine you can use python3 with the command: py -m http.server <port>
  * In this case:
   * Master Display: http://localhost:PORT/Apps/Sandcastle/gallery/1SyncBird.html?mode=m
   * Slave Displays: http://localhost:PORT/Apps/Sandcastle/gallery/1SyncBird.html?mode=s

  on your web browser(not Windows Edge).

* If you just start http://localhost:PORT/Apps/Sandcastle/gallery/1SyncBird.html or the mode value is unknown(not one of those [m, master, s, slave]), it will start as a not synchronized version.
